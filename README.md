VisVR is an experimental project using D3.js(version 5) and aframe(version 0.7.0). The motivation for this project is to experiment with 3 dimensional visualizations in 6 degree-of-freedom VR environments. With the introduction of advanced VR devices, can data analysts benefit from this new immersive interface? Since the visualization community has understood that 3D visualizations in 2D screens are far from usable, can new characteristics such as stereoscopic view, 6-DOF movement, and hand controllers make a difference in the analytic capabilities of 3D visualizations?
As we try to answer these questions we also explore the possibilities of new representations and also interactions for visualizations in this 3D environment.
We target the web as a platform for easy distribution and cross-platform access. Even users who do not have access to a VR device can have a taste of the experience and most of the capabilities.
